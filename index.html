            <h2>Species of Thailand</h2>
            <p>The great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) also known as the concave-casqued hornbill, great Indian hornbill
                or great pied hornbill, is one of the larger members of the hornbill family. It is found in the Indian
                subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal
                cultures and rituals. The great hornbill is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is
                predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.
                Like other members of the hornbill family, they have highly pneumatized bones, with hollow air cavities
                extending to the tips of the wing bones. This anatomical feature was noted by Richard Owen, who
                dissected a specimen that died at the Zoological Society of London in 1833.</p>
            <p>The species was formerly broken into subspecies cavatus, from the Western Ghats, and homrai, the nominate
                form from the sub-Himalayan forests. The subspecies from Sumatra was sometimes called cristatus.
                Variation across populations is mainly in size, Himalayan birds being larger than those from further
                south, and the species is now usually considered monotypic. Great hornbills are found in the forests of
                India, Bhutan, Nepal, Mainland Southeast Asia, Indonesian Island of Sumatra and North eastern region of
                India. The distribution of the species is fragmented over its range in the Indian subcontinent and
                Southeast Asia. In the subcontinent they are found in a few forest areas in the Western Ghats and in the
                forests along the Himalayas. Deforestation has reduced their range in many parts of India such as in the
                Kolli hills where they were recorded in the 1860s. Their distribution extends into Thailand, Burma,
                Malaya, and Sumatra. A small feral population is found in Singapore. Their habitat is dense old growth
                (unlogged) forests in hilly regions. They appear to be dependent on large stretches of forest, unlike
                many of the smaller hornbills.</p>

            <h2>THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BIRDS</h2>
            <p>Great hornbills are usually seen in small parties, with larger groups sometimes aggregating at fruit
                trees. A congregation of 150 to 200 birds has been recorded in southeastern Bhutan. In the wild, the
                great hornbill's diet consists mainly of fruit. Figs are particularly important as a food source. Vitex
                altissima has been noted as another important food source. Great hornbills also forage on lipid-rich
                fruits of the families Lauraceae and Myristicaceae such as Persea, Alseodaphne and Myristica. They
                obtain the water that they need entirely from their diet of fruits. They are important dispersers of
                many forest tree species. They will also eat small mammals, birds, small reptiles and insects.
                Lion-tailed macaques have been seen to forage alongside these hornbills.</p>
            <p>During the breeding season (January to April) great hornbills become very vocal. They make loud duets,
                beginning with a loud "kok" given about once a second by the male, to which the female joins in. The
                pair then calls in unison, turning into a rapid mixture of roars and barks. They prefer mature forests
                for nesting. Large, tall and old trees, particularly emergents that rise above the canopy, seem to be
                preferred for nesting. They form monogamous pair bonds and live in small groups of 2-40 individuals.
                Group courtship displays involving up to 20 birds have been observed.

                The female hornbill builds a nest in the hollow of a large tree trunk, sealing the opening with a
                plaster made up mainly of feces. She remains imprisoned there, relying on the male to bring her food,
                until the chicks are half developed. During this period the female undergoes a complete moult. The young
                chicks have no feathers and appear very plump. The mother is fed by her mate through a slit in the seal.
                The clutch consists of one or two eggs, which she incubates for 38–40 days. The female voids feces
                through the nest slit, as do the chicks from the age of two weeks. Once the female emerges from the
                nest, the chicks seal it again.</p>
